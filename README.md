Kryn.cms - A full-featured CMS bundle for the Symfony framework
========

An enterprise and high-speed open-source Content-Management-System (CMS) based on the Symfony framework with a full RESTful API,
a user friendly administration interface and rapid application development (RAD) framework using Composer, Propel and
other rock-solid libraries.

We're in development. This means, there are still a _lot_ of issues in this product (not even an Alpha) and it's not everything implemented yet.
